# Module4-Challange
This is the Quiz Project

I was pretty sick during this time but i tried my best. My biggest issue was trying to get the quiz to correct the user or display a right or wrong message once the decision was picked.

I felt i spent way too much time on this part and only allowed myself about 2 hours to try and do everything else. I got some ideas from the web but i was unable to get it to work the way i wanted. I will be turing this in again

I was also having issues (due to lack of time) wih trying to transition the slides, im pretty sure i could figure it out if given a little more time and not be sick, lol
